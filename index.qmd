#### About Me

I'm an an external Faculty Member at the [Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology (SMI)](https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in), in Bangalore, INDIA. I am passionate about working on R, Data Visualization, Complexity Science, and Creative Thinking and Problem Solving with TRIZ. On this website, I share my course materials and methods. I also blog about TRIZ and Data Science on occasion.

#### About This Course

On this website, I introduce the recently released [`tidyplots` package](https://tidyplots.org) by [Jan Broder Engler](https://www.jbengler.de/). I intend to show off the capabilities of this package for rapid Exploratory Data Visualization using a series of slide shows.
